# evm-ui monorepo template

> **Note:** This template is a fork of the [shadcn/ui monorepo template](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/tree/main/templates/monorepo-next).

This is a solid template to build a modern Ethereum/EVM UI that interacts with the blockchain. It provides a robust foundation for developing dApps with cutting-edge UI components, streamlined wallet integrations, and efficient blockchain communication. Whether you're building a DeFi app, NFT project, or any blockchain-powered application, this template gives you the essential building blocks to get started quickly.

## Usage

```bash
pnpm dlx evm-ui@latest init
```

## Adding components

To add components to your app, run the following command at the root of your `interface` app:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
```

This will place the UI components in the `packages/ui/src/components` directory.

## Included Packages

- **wagmi**  
  A React Hooks library for Ethereum, wagmi simplifies wallet connections and blockchain interactions.

- **rainbowkit**  
  RainbowKit is a React library that provides a streamlined and customizable way to connect crypto wallets to your dApp, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **viem**  
  Viem offers low-level, stateless TypeScript primitives for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling efficient contract interactions and data fetching.

- **@tanstack/react-query**  
  TanStack Query is an async state manager that handles server state, caching, and background updates, improving data fetching and synchronization across your app.

## Tailwind

Your `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css` are already set up to use the components from the `ui` package.

## Using components

To use the components in your app, import them from the `ui` package.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@workspace/ui/components/button"
```

## Adding new ABIs

When adding a new ABI, follow these steps:
1. Drop the new ABI JSON file into the `packages/contracts/abis` folder.
2. Within the `packages/contracts` directory, run:
   
   ```bash
   pnpm generate
   ```
   
   (Use your package manager's equivalent command if not using pnpm.)

This template packs in everything you need for building a robust and scalable Ethereum interface, from integrated wallet connection libraries to efficient blockchain communication tools. Itâ€™s built to help you focus on developing unique features for your dApp, while handling the heavy lifting of blockchain interactions and state management for you.
